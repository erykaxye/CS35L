1. If the other teams were observing all the bytes going across the network,
my resulting network is still secure. The bytes are encryted by my public
and private key and therefore, even if they could have access to my public 
key, they would be hard-pressed to figure out my private key because it is
stored on my computer and it is extremely hard to figure out a private key
from a public key. 
(1) If they were reading my keystrokes as well, it would still be secure 
because our private key is generated differently each time we type in the 
password.  
(2) If they had physical control of a USB that I was booting off, then it
would no longer be secure because they can just find the system files on 
the USB drive and directly read our private key data and decrypt our 
communications and log onto the server.   

2. The gpg --verify only verifies if a target file and the detached 
signatures match. But that only works if the person checking knows my public
key already. Otherwise, someone else could replace my public key and create 
the files and output the same detached signature and the command would still
say that I created the files. 
To fix this, everyone needs to know my public key so they can verify the key
after downloading my files using hashing algorithms.
