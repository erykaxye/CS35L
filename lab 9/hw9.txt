2. 
Then I cloned the unmodified version of diffutils into a new folder and
checked out v3.0 like before

$ git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/diffutils.git diffutils-og
$ cd diffutils-og/
$ git checkout v3.0 -b quote
Switched to a new branch 'quote'
$ git status
# On branch quote
nothing to commit (working directory clean)



3. To install my change onto this new branch, I ran the following command
$ patch -p1 < ~/assign9/gitroot/diffutils/quote-3.0-patch.txt
patching file src/cmp.c
patching file src/diff.c
patching file src/diff3.c
patching file src/dir.c
patching file src/sdiff.c
patching file src/util.c



5. 

$ emacs ChangeLog-2008

Using the Emacs function add-change-log-entry-other-window (C-x 4 a), I 
composed a ChangeLog entry for my patch. 

2019-03-13  Erica Xie  <ericax@lnxsrv05.seas.ucla.edu>

        * ChangeLog-2008: Changed the following files so that they output '
        instead of `.


        * src/cmp.csrc/cmp.c
        * src/diff.c
        * src/diff3.c
        * src/dir.c
        * src/sdiff.c
        * src/util.c



6. Then I committed my changes to the new branch with the ChangeLog entry 
as the commit message.

$ git add .
$ git commit -F ChangeLog

7. Then I  generated a file formatted-patch.txt. 

$ git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt



8. Then I sent my formatted patch to my partner and she sent me hers. I had
to delete my ChangeLog, but after that the patch worked with the following
commands: 

$ cd checkout master 
$ $ git checkout v3.0 -b partner
$ git am < mich-formatted-patch.txt

$ patch -p0 < diffutils-get.diff
$ ./bootstrap 
$ make 
$ make check 



9. To verify that her ChangeLog entry works, I ran the commands below 
$ make distdir 
$ emacs ChangeLog

The ChangeLog was a log of her changes and previous edits to the file.



10. Then I opened a new session of putty with X11 forwarding enabled and 
made sure that I had XMing running in the background. 

$ cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs
$ gitk
 
Then I took a screenshot of what I saw and wrote a short description
