I used wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz to 
downloard coreutils-8.29 to my home directory. 
Then I untarred and unzipped it using tar -xJvf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz 
I then made a directory called coreutilsInstall. 
Then I went into the coreutils-8.29 directory and ran the command 
./configure --prefix coreutilsInstall to install into the directory 
i just made. 
I compiled it using the make command. 
I installed it using the make install command. 
Then I tested if the bug was still there by running the ls -a -A command. 
I used emacs to open patch_file and copied and pasted the patch content
given in the assignment. 
Then I used patch -p1 patch_file 
I got an error, but my patch still worked. 
The error was:
patching file NEWS
Hunk #1 FAILED at 4.
1 out of 1 hunk FAILED -- saving rejects to file NEWS.rej
patching file src/ls.c
Hunk #1 succeeded at 1900 (offset -3 lines).
patching file tests/local.mk
Hunk #1 FAILED at 575.
1 out of 1 hunk FAILED -- saving rejects to file tests/local.mk.rej
patching file tests/ls/a-option.sh
This error occured because I copied in the entire diff file into the 
patch file instead of only the part that was patched. 
Then I used the make command to compile, but I did not install. 
I entered the src directory inside coreutils-8.29 and ran ./ls -aA
and it worked with the patch. 
Then I entered coreutilsInstall and tested ./ls -aA in unmodified directory
and the patch was not applied. 
Then I did a few more tests on empty directories and hidden files 
and the modified ls still works correctly, with the added patch of 
./ls -aA
