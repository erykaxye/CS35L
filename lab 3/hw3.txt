Q1. The performance of ls is better now because the patch removed an 
if statement so there's less lines of code to execute and now -A is 
also always overiding -a which fixes the bug that was previously in 
the ls code.   

Q2. If your company adopts this patched version, you have to watch out for 
order of the flags becuase now -A and -a override each other depending
on the order they are given. 

Q3. If I run randline.py on /dev/null, it outputs this error message: 

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "randline.py", line 70, in <module>
    main()
  File "randline.py", line 64, in main
    sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
  File "randline.py", line 34, in chooseline
    return random.choice(self.lines)
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.6/random.py", line 261, in choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  
    # raises IndexError if seq is empty
IndexError: list index out of range

This is because it is trying to find a line in a file, but there is 
nothing in the file to find so it throws an IndexError. 

Q4. When I run randline.py on python3, I get this error. 

  File "randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

This is because python3 doesn't support tuples, so the correct syntax is
except IOError as err.
